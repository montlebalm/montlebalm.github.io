My name is Chris Montrois. I'm a Web Developer at [Markit on Demand](http://www.wallst.com/).

I earned my bachelors from Florida State University in 2008, and went on to work for some great Fortune 500 banks. I snuck off to Colorado in 2011 and never looked back.

If I'm not programming for fun, you can usually find me slacklining, playing frisbee golf, brewing beer, playing trivia, or butchering some misguided woodworking project.
