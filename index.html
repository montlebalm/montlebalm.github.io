  <h1>Why, hello there</h1>
  <p>
    I’m Chris, an adult man with nearly authentic human emotions. I don’t live
    on the internet, but I do occasionally
    <a href="http://twitter.com/montlebalm">tweet</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/montlebalm">write code</a>. I also
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/chris-montrois/9/4b1/b4a">work</a>, but
    not by choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is a series of learnings in my pursuit of programming for fun and
    profit. Hat tip to the invaluable sources credited in the entries.
