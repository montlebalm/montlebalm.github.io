# Hello there

I am Chris Montrois, a computer programmer with nearly authentic human
emotions. I've been known to tweet on [Twitter][twitter], liason on
[LinkedIn][linkedin], git on [GitHub][github], and fine-tune [Flickr][flickr]
photos.

My greatest weaknesses are that I'm too handsome and smart and humble. If that
isn't a problem for you, take a look at my [resume][resume].

Ocassionally I do things. You can find some of my work if you look down just
a bit.
