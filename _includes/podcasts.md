  Roderick on the Line</a>
is a weekly, hour-long phone call between [Merlin Mann][tw-mann] and [John
Roderick][tw-roderick]. Topics include music, Hitler, and owls disguides as
pillows. I frequently find myself laughing or making a "you know, he's right"
kind of face. You can't afford not to be saved.

  Accidental Tech Podcast</a>
is a weekly show about recent tech news hosted by [Casey Liss][tw-liss], [Marco
Arment][tw-arment], and [John Siracusa][tw-siracusa]. The topics cover a range
of platforms, but focuses primarily on Apple.
