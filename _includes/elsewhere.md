<a href="http://modl.markit.com/articles/live-data-binding-with-angularjs-react-emberjs/" class="title-link" data-site="modl">Live Data Binding with AngularJS, React and EmberJS</a>
is a piece I wrote for MOD/L about how modern JavaScript frameworks can help
you incorporate real-time content with minimal effort.

<a href="http://go.quickleft.com/lunch-and-learn-emberjs" class="title-link" data-site="vimeo">Ember.js: The Serious JavaScript Framework for Responsible Grown-Ups</a>
is a presentation I gave on Ember.js to [Quick Left][ql] during a developer
Lunch & Learn. In the talk I cover the basics of Ember including what it is and
why you might want to use it. Here's a [repo][ember-notes] with my slides,
notes, and demo code.
