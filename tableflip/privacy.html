        <h3>Tracking</h3>
        <p>The <code>/tableflip</code> command is completely stateless, which means we don't store any information about you. There's no record of what you or your team types outside of Slack.</p>
        <p>What about cookies you ask? No cookies!</p>

        <h3>User info</h3>
        <p>Tableflip doesn't request access to your team's data so it doesn't know all the weird things you talk about. It can't listen to your secret secrets or the places you like to go for lunch.</p>
        <p>Slash commands receive a limited amount of user information. Specifically they receive encoded ids for the current team, channel, and user. For more information check out the Slack API docs for <a href="https://api.slack.com/slash-commands#triggering_a_command">triggering a command</a>.</p>
