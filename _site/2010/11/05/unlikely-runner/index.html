		<div class="span8 post-content"><p>For years I willfully accepted the role of the powerful athlete that cared little for extended stamina. I easily dismissed emails promising me that which I lacked (for a mere $9.99) and focused my will on strength based exercises involving triceps and latissimus dorsi. My fast twitch muscles were primed for the opportunity to elevate some reluctant ballast for a mere five seconds and promptly pass out.</p>

<p>Everything changed one month ago when I bought my wife a pair of <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_bikila_f.cfm?CFID=6894564&CFTOKEN=30256168">Vibram Five Finger</a> shoes. We'd heard of them through a mutual friend and she'd like the idea of getting away from high tech running gear. As a lifelong evader of distance sports, it made sense for me to get a pair as well. Now, as daft as it sounds, I did have a plan.</p>

<p><img alt="Bikilas in blue" src="/img/posts/5072141810_dfaa1630be_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>These shoes have an introductory period that requires you to start out running short distances to avoid straining your calves. This early period was my only chance of keeping up with my wife as she routinely heads out for runs beyond my imagination. In my mind, she crosses state borders like sidewalk cracks and turns around when she hits the antipodal coast.</p>

<p>As it turns out, my plan was flawed from the beginning since she was in good enough shape that she all but bypassed this period of acclimation. Instead, <em>I</em> was the one running a half mile at a time coming home with throbbing calves. For some reason I couldn't put my finger on, ambling about in these shoes was actually a little fun. At first these new feelings scared me, since I saw through running's clever marketing to her masochistic core within. Eventually though, my cynicism wore off and I started taking to the streets more and more.</p>

<p>I should mention that, when I first started, I had to push myself through the last quarter of a one mile run; I was that bad. My poor wife would get calls every other day with exclamations like, "I ran a mile today!" To her credit she humored me the whole way through.</p>

<p>Despite my lack of innate running talent, I kept up the exercise and couldn't be happier. In fact, I recently completed the longest run of my life clocking in at just over six miles. Somehow, in one month I managed to go from topping out at the end of a single mile to being disappointed to see my driveway after six. If there's anything to be learned from this, it's that it doesn't matter how bad you are at the beginning. Just keep working at whatever it is you want to do and deficiency will take its rightful place under the steel-toed boots of domination.</p>
