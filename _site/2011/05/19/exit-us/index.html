		<div class="span8 post-content"><p>It's official. My wife and I are moving from Jacksonville, FL to Boulder, CO. We've been considering the move for some time, and I was recently offered a job that was too good to pass up. A big thanks goes out to my wife's boss, who, upon hearing her intent to resign, vowed to find her a job inside or outside the company. 24 hours later, he made good on his word. True story.</p>

<p><img alt="Tallahassee to Boulder" src="/img/posts/tallahassee-to-boulder.jpg" /></p>

<h1>The trip</h1>

<p>One-thousand, six-hundred, and forty-six miles.
Three days.
Two cats.
One Honda Civic.
Zero bathroom breaks.</p>

<p>I'm much more excited for a twenty-seven hour drive than I should be. Being excited at all seems abnormal. Although, imagine how the migrators of the early United States would have felt if a Japanese horse made of steel descended from the heavens and promised to take them West. Not only would be quicker, but they probably <em>wouldn't die</em>. I didn't even mention the air conditioning.</p>

<p>We still haven't figured out what to do about the cats, but we'll stock up on enough sedatives to last them through the new year. As long as we don't have to stop mid-trip and hastily wet wipe a soiled feline I will consider it a success. We've looked into partitioning off the back seat with some cleverly rigged cloth, but I don't think anything short of bullet-proof glass will hold them once we get on the road.</p>

<p>Whatever else it is, it will be a super fun time, cross country, party adventure extravaganza.</p>
