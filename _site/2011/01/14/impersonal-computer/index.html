		<div class="span8 post-content"><p>I recently posted <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/beardog/status/26008471488958464">this thought</a> on twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p>What if you had to be polite to your computer to unlock its full potential.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea came to me this afternoon while considering our relationship with computers. "Hey nerd, your laptop doesn't love you," I hear someone say. Then again, you probably spend as much time looking at a screen as anything else. The experience we have while on our machines could have a greater psychological impact than we realize. What if you had to say "Please" in order for an application to launch with all available resources? Would nine hours in front of that screen feel a little more personal?</p>

<p>Ultimately, today's computer doesn't have anything with which to reward you for good behavior; it's the fastest it will ever be the day you unbox it. What if your processor sped up over time and you looked forward to next year when it would be faster? Instead, you cover your ears and run out of the store to curb buyer's remorse for at least the ride home.</p>

<p>Imagine purchasing a computer that's 60% faster than the one it's replacing. What if, on first boot, the hardware is configured to give you a mere 30% boost in performance? Each year, it gains an additional 10% of the withheld power and literally gets faster over time. After three years, your computer would be at its maximum potential and only then begin its inevitable decline.</p>

<p>I don't believe it's the loss of processing power we disdain, but rather the perception of it. We live in an era where computers are more than capable of performing any civilian task. Yet we still feel the pang of disappointment when our beloved Model 2 is replaced by the novel Model 3. Initially suppressing a portion of a computer's power wouldn't hinder your daily activities, but might reward you psychologically over time.</p>

<p>These feelings towards computing power originated with my first laptop. The hardware in my Apple Titanium Powerbook was outdated when I got it, so the expectation of supremacy never entered my mind. I simply loved the computer for what it was and eight years later it's still on my desk.</p>

<p>I'd like to claim this as a devil's advocate daydream, but I'd be lying. I'd actually like to see this done on a small scale and examine the affect over time. Perhaps the increases would be too gradual and you'd feel as though you'd been robbed. On the other hand, confirmation bias might lead you to attribute each bit of quickness to the performance allowance and make you feel immensely satisfied. The world may never know.</p>
