Touchscreens won the war for your pocket and that's mostly a Good Thing.

We love our new smartphone companions and shudder at the bad old days when we used physical map to get around. Unfortunately, touchscreens also represent an insidious divergence from an important form of communication: tactile feedback.

Modern day smartphones -- fullscreen touch devices -- exceed at providing visual feedback. When you press an on-screen button, it looks pressed. Screens slide to the left and right when you swipe across them. Content scrolls with a one to one relationship to your finger. Visual fidelity has been enhanced by the ability to convert the entire screen to the purpose at hand. Our phones are great at being touched. The problem is, they don't touch back.

So much of the information we receive on a daily basis comes by way of our skin. We can gauge the ambient temperature of a room just by being in it. We're constantly absorbing information from air currents, vibrations, and wives punching us for misogynistic remarks. Our sense of touch is arguably our most important source of feedback and it is almost entirely ignored by touchscreen devices.

My current stereo is a 1970 Kenwood receiver. In order to change the audio input, I apply clockwise pressure to a dial until I feel it click into place. I don't have to look to see if I succeeded; I can feel it change. You can't feel the keys being pressed on your software keyboard. Instead, you have to wait for it to show up on the screen.

Look, you'll have to pry my iPhone from my cold, dead, baby soft hands. I'm not advocating for a return to hardware keyboards and a menagerie of fixed purpose buttons. Instead, we should enhance capacitive devices with better tactile feedback, such as the ability to raise or lower sections of the screen.

The current crop of phones is the best there's every been, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking the next big evolution is increasing the screen size by one inch. We're in a brave new world of technology, and there's still a lot of land to cover.
