I'm going to start with what I've learned. I've learned that staying on top of the web takes time. I've learned that the cutting edge of a corporate intranet is not the same as the cutting edge. I've learned that people lose basic skills when they -- the skills -- are left to atrophy. Mostly, I've learned that the best way to teach yourself is to try and teach someone else.

If I had a mission statement, it would be to inform myself and the developer community through casual, instructional writing. It is as much a personal refresher as it is to give back, which is why I'll be visiting such basic topics as browser bugs and Doctypes. Through writing, I'll discuss current projects as well as best practices on the web.
