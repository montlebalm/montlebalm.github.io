The following account details a harrowing tale of an out of shape man and his intrepid companions. Reader discretion is advised.

The morning started out like any other. I awoke to the growing crescendo of an alarm chime I'm growing to hate. Molly, a "Morning Person", was already awake and beaming. I let out a noise that might have been confused with a groan had it not been bursting with the abyssal emptiness of each of a thousand early mornings. Well, enough about that.

We finished getting ready and drove to Denver so we could carpool with Jean and Ben. Our destination, Yeoman Park Trailhead, was still a couple hours drive west into the mountains. Good company expedited an otherwise monotonous journey. Along the way we encountered batmobiles, dum dums, and pieces Jean's disintegrating car.

Once we reached the trailhead, the car surrendered its gear in an eruption of nylon and goretex. Its binge became our burden. Two hundred pounds of scattered gear got bolted onto our bodies like a backpacking episode of The Centurions.
